# Varsity-Soko

**Varsity-Soko** is a mobile application designed to empower university students by creating a connected campus community. The app allows students to share information, showcase and sell products, and engage with peers, enhancing both their social and entrepreneurial experience. Varsity-Soko aligns with **UN SDG 1 (No Poverty)** and **SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth)** by promoting student entrepreneurship and economic activity within campuses.

## Features

* **Student Marketplace:** Post, sell, and promote products.
* **24-Hour Product Showcases:** Highlight products or engagement posts temporarily.
* **Community Feed:** University updates, memes, tips, and events.
* **Direct Communication:** Quick access to information without relying on email.
* **Integrated Profile & Networking:** Connect with peers and potential customers.

## Problem Statements

1. **Student business exposure limitations:** Most student startups rely on platforms like WhatsApp. Potential customers are often inconvenienced by group or status-based communication, reducing engagement and sales.
2. **Inefficient university communication:** Universities primarily use email, which many Gen-Z students find slow, leading to gaps in accessing timely information.

**Solution:** Varsity-Soko bridges the gap by creating a centralized platform where students can access university updates, engage with peers, and promote their businesses seamlessly.
